# Attrition-Rate-Prediction
Attrition to any company can lead to a lot of cost and to take care of it, the company is looking to create a model that can predict the attrition. This company maintains a database of the employees and their details. Based on this dataset, the requirement is to create the classification model using K-Nearest Neighbour to predict if the employee will leave the company or not (attrition rate).  There are around 1400+ records using which you need to create a model after breaking the data into test and train.
Project Tasks
•	Pre-processing the data.
o	Missing Value Treatment 
o	Outlier Treatment if required 
o	Feature Scaling 
o	Encoding or any other technique to make categorial to Numerical data
•	Do extensive exploratory data analysis before creating the model.
o	Write the detailed conclusions from the analysis. 
o	Identify the variables you think are the most important ones.
•	Splitting the dataset into train and test sets (if required).
•	Apply the algorithm which you have learnt, i.e., K-Nearest Neighbour.
o	Applying the K-Fold cross validation technique, you need to find the best value of the K (Nearest Neighbours) so that the model will not be overfitted or underfitted. 
•	At the end, write the detailed analysis and the behavior you saw from the experiments. 
•	Finding the best performing model using the accuracy score, confusion matrix, TPR, FPR, TNR, FNR, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve, and loss function. Explain the interpretation of the result.
